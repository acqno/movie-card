## Movie Card

This project was developed to learn how to use the react library. 

It renders a movie card component to the browser and prompts the user to search for a movie. Using [the movie db](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US) API, it renders the movie information in a simple movie card format. 

### Example
