## Movie Card

This project was developed to learn how to use the react library. 

It renders a movie card component to the browser and prompts the user to search for a movie. Using [the movie db](https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api?language=en-US) API, it renders the movie information in a simple card format. 

### Example

### Future Improvements
    - add more details for movie card eg. ratings, genre
    - mobile responsiveness
    - implement watch list where users can create a list of movies to watch

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
